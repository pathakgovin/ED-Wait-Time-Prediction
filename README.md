\# 🏥 ED Wait Time Prediction – Machine Learning for Healthcare



Predicting Emergency Department (ED) wait times using data analytics and machine learning to improve hospital efficiency and patient care.



---



\## 📌 Project Overview



This project applies machine learning to predict Emergency Department (ED) wait times across U.S. hospitals.  

By analyzing hospital characteristics from \[Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://data.cms.gov/) datasets, the project identifies factors that impact wait times and builds predictive models to improve efficiency and decision-making.



\*\*Key Steps:\*\*

\- ✔️ Data Preprocessing \& Cleaning  

\- ✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

\- ✔️ Machine Learning Model Development  

\- ✔️ Visualization \& Insights

\## 💡 Key Insights



\- 🏥 Teaching hospitals \& larger hospitals → generally longer wait times  

\- 🌆 Urban hospitals → higher patient flow \& bottlenecks  

\- 🏛 Ownership type → significant differences in performance  

\- 📊 Ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) provide the most reliable predictions
